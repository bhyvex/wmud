--- CircleMUD 3.1

11/19/2002

-- ae - act.informative.c, act.item.c, act.social.c, act.wizard.c, act.other.c,
		alias.c, castle.c:
		Began adding descriptions of each SYSERR in comments following
		the actually log lines in the code.  These are marked with a
		'SYSERR_DESC:' tag, in the hopes that we can write a program
		that will automatically collect the log message and descriptive
		comments and compile a single document containing all of the
		information.

-- ae - alias.c: Changed double log entries (with 'perror()' statements) to
                put strerror() statements at the end of the single log line
                rather than on a separate line.

12/02/2002

-- ae - utils.h: Changed core_dump_real() prototype.  If we're going to fully
		prototype everything else, why isn't this one?  Pointed out
		by Jesper R.jest.l<jesper@aradja.com>

01/06/2003

-- dk - interpreter.c: one_word() no longer ignores fill words, which caused
		some keywords to be ignored in help file loading (the only
		thing this function is used for in stock).  Run into by
		Thomas Arp <t_arp@stofanet.dk>.

01/15/2003

-- gg - comm.c: free_bufpool(); mail.c: free_mail_index(): New.
		Idea (not code) from Thomas Arp <t_arp@STOFANET.DK>

-- gg - db.c: destroy_db(): Don't leak memory from followers list.
		Only matters (briefly) when using 'shutdown' command.

-- gg - house.c: hcontrol_list_houses(): Correct a sizeof() in strlcpy().

03/31/2003

-- ae - act.movement.c: do_rest() had people going into the SITTING position
		if they had a previously undefined position.  Discovered by
		Thomas Arp <t_arp@stofanet.dk>.

04/09/2003

-- ae - boards.c: Board_clear_board() has a memory clearing "bug" that can
		cause issue on some systems.  Found by Burkhard Knopf
		<burkhard.knopf@tu-clausthal.de>

04/19/2003

-- ae - 25.obj, 120.obj, 72.wld: some typos fixed courtesy of Ken Ray
		<kenr86@HOTMAIL.COM>

05/29/2003

-- ae - spells.c: fixed an output type in locate_object courtesy of
		Edward Glamkowski <eglamkowski@angelfire.com>
