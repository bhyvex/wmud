wMUD TODO file

* Store EVERYTHING in an SQLite3 database

* At least two threads. One of them should continuously write everything back
  to the database, while the other one should serve the connections. Maybe the
  out-of-game chat should be outsourced to a separate thread, either.

* All descriptions should be written in a markup language to support bold,
  underline, colours, and such

* Movement
  o 10 directions (N, E, S, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, U, D)
  o Also, some rooms may have other exits, like portals, which can be ENTER'ed.
  o Doors can be locked or hidden

* Planets/Planes
  o Rooms are connected to Planets
  o Planets are connected to Planes
  o Rooms may have different descriptions depending on the Plane the Character
    is active on

* Commands already defined in Zim Wiki:
  o DROP
  o GET
  o PRACISE/PRACTICE
  o PRAY
  o RECALL should take back the character to their house, or the Inn room they
    have rented. Specific rooms may have a flag so there must be no recall from
    them (this should also mean that upon logout/login, the character will get
    back to this room)
  o SURVEY
  o TALE

* Commands that should be present
  o AFFECTS to show all the spells that affects the character (spell name,
    apply count, duration, applier name)
  o SCORE to show the player's statistics
  o INVENTORY to show the character's inventory
  o EQUIPMENT to show the equipped items
  o AUTOEXIT to toggle exit display on LOOK
  o LOOK
  o EXITS
  o EXAMINE should be an alias to LOOK, except it should work only on objects
  o CONSIDER
  o SET
    . AUTOLOOT    [OFF]
    . AUTOSKIN    [OFF]
    . AUTODRAIN   [OFF]
    . AUTOSPLIT   [OFF]
    . COLOR       [ON ]
    . AUTOLOOK    [ON ]
    . WIMPY       [OFF]
    . AUTOCONSUME [OFF] (To automatically consume food and drink when
                         hungry/thirsty)
    . GROUPINV    [ON ]
    . PAGELENGTH  [30 ]
  o BURY/DIG
  o EQUIP/WIELD
  o IGNORE/UNIGNORE
  o WHO/WHOIS
  o QUIT should exit the game
  o LOGOUT should go back to intro menu
  o USE may use objects in hand (map, weapons with spells, etc.), or in room
    (buttons, levers, etc.)

* Player grouping (AKA Party)

* Housing system should automatically expand towns (this will be fun to write).
  Maybe a better alternative is to check for free housing and if the amount
  goes too low, manually create some new one.
  o Housing should be decorated with different objects.

* The whole world should have one fallback start location (Tree of Memories?)

* All Races have at least one possible start locations

* People start in a well-defined start location (randomly selected during
  character generation)

* Characters can set their hometown in an Inn; however, Inns have only a
  limited amount of rooms. Inn rooms cost some amount of gold per day, which is
  pre-paid. If the rent is over, the character's start location is set to one
  of the racial defaults. If the character is online when the rent is over,
  they should get a warning message about this. If the player gets an own
  house, their home location should be automatically set to it

* Item creation (AKA combining or Professions, like Blacksmithing and Alchemy)
  o Trainers, who know only specific recipes
  o Recipe scrolls (e.g to be dropped by mobs and such)
  o Corpse skinning (only specific corpses)
  o Corpse butching (only specific corpses)
  o Fishing
  o Mining
  o Foraging

* Container items (bags)

* Companions
  o Combat/Pack animals
  o Mounts (may also act as combat/pack animals)
  o Charming

* Auction system

* Item donation

* Gods
  o Gods may be chosen upon character creation (for wMUD, a character MUST have
    at least two Gods)

* Reputation system

* Player Guilds

* Sacrifices

* Prayers

* Item types
  o Armour/Clothing
    . Shields
  o Weapon
    . Ballista
    . Bashing
    . Bow
    . Crossbow
    . Club
    . Knuckle
    . Lash
    . Net
    . Piercing
    . Slashing
    . Whip
  o Potion
  o Poison (appliable to weapons)
  o Food/Water/Alcohol/Sugar
  o Light
    . Maybe these objects (or some of them) should be seen in the dark
  o Spell reagent
  o Material
  o Artifacts

* Death system, Rebirth

* War Machines

* Shops
  o Most shops should open/close depending on the in-game time

* Skills/Spells/Talents granted by the Gods
  o Fear

* Magic Profession

* Fighting Professions with practicing
  o Disarm
  o Dual Wield
  o Stun

* The whole system should be built with class support, although wMUD will
  technically have only one "Adventurer" class. Also, multiclassing should be
  possible

* Character aging, with racial maximum age. When a character is too old, they
  can retire (e.g they will become story tellers or such), or die and rebirth.
  Reborn characters have a bonus to their maximum age. Upon rebirth they create
  a totally new character, with all their old data remaining in the database.
  Reborn characters have the possibility to regain all their old powers after a
  few years

* Quests given by NPCs

* Player creatable quests

* In-game chat (whisper, say, shout, emotes, group/party, guild). Guild chat
  should be accessible without entering the game (from the Circle-like main
  menu), or even via IRC or something like that

* Speedwalking?

* Arenas

* Player killing/thieving should be enabled/disabled per world

* Mercy mob flag: mobs will stop attacking if their enemy is unable to fight
  any more

* Mobs should be able to wear/wield items, have an inventory, have Skills,
  Spells and Talents

* Sneaking, thieving, robbery
  o A mob may steal stuff from you, you may detect it, and maybe able to catch
    it and get your stuff back. However, killing them in a city may result in
    punishment by the guards.

* Gossips

* Bragging NPCs: if a character gets killed by a specific NPCs, those NPCs will
  humiliate that character for a while

* Weapon USE: wielded weapons may do something (like cast spells or such) if a
  specific attribute is set. The item spell should recharge over time, or
  recharge upon a specific condition

* Money (with the possibility to create several money types, like different
  currencies for different Races)

* Banks
  o Money deposit (with interest in some banks)
  o Storage, for a fee
  o Loans

* Guild bank

* All looted items should be used in some way or another. Sacrifice is a common
  way, but some items may be milled (e.g bones and herbs) or disassembled (e.g
  Mechanics objects or armour), others may be used as raw materials. Extracted
  body parts (e.g blood or meat) should decompose over time, even in an
  inventory, unless put in a special container

* Object affects and attribute modifiers, like an earring which make the
  character deaf. These affects may be hidden, and even delayed (e.g the
  character puts on the earring that gives a high amount of charisma, but after
  wearing it for a specific time, they will become deaf, and they will have no
  idea what caused it. The same object can also be cursed, so it cannot be
  removed except by some professional magicians

* Item modifiers, like sharpening stones

* Item durability. Items must have a Profession and a Profession Level
  associated to them to show who can repair it

* <mob> arrives from <direction>

* Character bounty, which can be placed by other characters for a fee (should
  be enabled per world), or NPCs.

* Guild wars (Players from a Guild may PK players from another Guild if the two
  Guilds are in war with each other)

* Mob glowing (e.g they will be unable to sneak)

* Polls

* Configurable prompt

* Marriage?

* Character titles, which can be rewards for quests, or be bought for a high
  amount of money

* Spirit world
  o Some rooms (at least one) should be marked as Spirit World. Upon death,
    characters get the DEAD flag, and get to this room. They must find their
    way to remove the DEAD flag, and/or find a way back to the real world.

* Blood may remain on the floor during a fight (even without a kill)

* Death trap rooms

* Regeneration rooms

* Teleportation objects (portal machines) and rooms (elevators)

* Languages

* Books

* Rivers should have some kind of a current. If you get into a river (even on a
  boat, or by swimming), it will move you automatically somewhere

* Gambling (may be illegal in some towns ;) )

* Guides that can be payed for. E.g in a big city, a guide can lead you to the
  Inn, or something like that for a small fee.

* Automatically hiding/appearing exits (e.g to created mazes to hide stuff)

* Mailing

* Abilities
  o Rolled upon character creation
  o May be trained
  o There should be a racial maximum
  o May be modified by affections and worn items
  o May increase/decrease with age
