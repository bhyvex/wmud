All texts must conform to the following standards:

They must provide a valid XML is wrapped with this template:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<wmud>
	<formatted-text>
		THE TEXT ITSELF
	</formatted-text>
</wmud>

Text can be formatted with the following tags:
<normal>TEXT</normal>            - provides normal text (clears all formatting)
<bold>TEXT</bold>                - provides bold text
<underline>TEXT</underline>      - provides underlined text
<COLOUR>TEXT</COLOUR>            - provides coloured text in the given colour, see below for exact tag names

Possible values for COLOUR:
* black
* red
* green
* yellow
* blue
* magenta
* cyan
* white

Please note that although most MUD clients support the above text formatting, some older terminals not.
Also, for telnet-like clients, the text is wrapped into 78 columns after formatting has been applied.
