# log can be "syslog" (to log through the syslog facility), "file:<filename>"
# to log to the specified file, "console" (to log to the console), or "none"
# (for no logging at all). console can be used only if compiled with debug
# support. If logging is set to console, wMUD cannot be daemonized!
log = console
# if you wish, you can send debug, info, warning and error message to different
# destinations by defining a "debug log", an "info log", a "warning log" and an
# "error log" respectively
#debug log = file:/home/polesz/Projektek/wMUD/data/debug.log

warning log = console
error log = console

# after initialization, send into the background. This setting is automatically
# set to "no" if logging is set to "console". However, if daemonize is set to
# "force", wMUD will be sent to the background, and will be forced to log
# through the syslog facilty

# the statesave module is used to save all the state of a running wMUD server.
# Only one module can be specified here, and one MUST be specified. Without
# such a module, wMUD won't be able to save character states, thus won't start
# without one
statesave = sqlite3
# wMUD doesn't speak any protocols on its own. Of course, several protocol
# handler modules are provided with wMUD, and these can be loaded here. Module
# names (thus, protocol names) can be separated by colons. At least one
# protocol module must be loaded here. After startup, a client with
# administrator privileges can load up more modules

# statesave * groups can have any keys and values, they won't get checked
# during the configfile read. They are only processed by the state saving
# module loaded in the modules group

# during initialization, only while actually loading up the modules.
